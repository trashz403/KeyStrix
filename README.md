# KeyStrix
Keystrix is an advanced keylogger project designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer system discreetly. It is developed with a focus on providing a comprehensive and efficient solution for tracking keyboard activities while maintaining user privacy and security.


# Key features
*  Stealth Mode: Keystrix operates silently in the background, without any noticeable impact on the system's performance or user experience. It runs as a hidden process, making it difficult for users to detect its presence.

*  Keylogging Functionality: The core functionality of Keystrix is to capture and log keystrokes typed by the user. It records all keystrokes, including text inputs, passwords, and other sensitive information entered through the keyboard.
   
*  Application Monitoring: Keystrix can monitor specific applications or windows, capturing keystrokes typed within those applications selectively. This feature allows for targeted monitoring of user activities in specific programs, such as web
   browsers, chat applications, or document editors.


# Purpose:
# The primary purpose of Keystrix is to provide a tool for monitoring and tracking keyboard activities on computer systems. It serves various purposes, including:

* Employee Monitoring: Employers can use Keystrix to monitor employee activities on company-owned computers to ensure compliance with company policies and prevent unauthorized use of resources.

* Parental Control: Parents can deploy Keystrix to monitor their children's online activities and identify any potentially harmful or inappropriate behavior.

* Security Auditing: Security professionals can utilize Keystrix for security auditing purposes, analyzing user behavior, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities or breaches.

* Law Enforcement: Law enforcement agencies can use Keystrix as part of forensic investigations to gather evidence related to cybercrimes, unauthorized access, or malicious activities.
